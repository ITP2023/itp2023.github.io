# Getting started with Langchain
Langchain is a popular (severe understatement) open-source library to work with all sorts of LLMs. It really serves as a higher-level abstraction library that simplifies having to build applications that leverage the many uses of LLMs.

This guide exists because:
- Many beginners might come across all sorts of terms and might feel confused.
- They might also find it tedious to download the very large LLMs, just to learn Langchain. In this guide, we'll use Microsoft's phi-1.5B model.
