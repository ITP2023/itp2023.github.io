# Writings

A few writings can be found on this website made with the intent of helping programmers by offering thema clear guide on some libraries The Prisoner had the fortune of encountering.

As such, you can expect this page to be updated every time a guide is out.

## Here they are

- [Getting GetX](/getting-getx/)
- [Reacting to Refine](/reacting-refine/)
